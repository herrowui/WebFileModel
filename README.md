# ASP.net MVC web files post and save 

Hi All<br>
I just want to share the idea and codes if you need. <br>
This is a sample that save the posted files and map the fields to your models <br>
The model does not save the files to database , if you need you can add by yourself in your projects.<br>
<br>
You can read the MyForm first then FileController.
